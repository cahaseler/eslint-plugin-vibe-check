# vibe-check Project Plan

## Project Overview

`vibe-check` is an ESLint plugin designed to provide warnings and guardrails for AI coding assistance. It aims to identify common pitfalls and quality issues that can arise when using AI-generated code.

## Current Status

- Basic plugin structure established
- Rules implemented:
  - `max-file-lines`: Warns when a file exceeds a configurable line count
  - `no-placeholder-comments`: Catches placeholder comments indicating shortcuts or unimplemented features
  - `no-hardcoded-credentials`: Detects hardcoded API keys, tokens, and other sensitive credentials
- Documentation, tests, and examples for existing rules
- NPM scripts for testing and linting

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- ✅ Set up basic plugin structure
- ✅ Implement first rule (`max-file-lines`)
- ✅ Implement second rule (`no-placeholder-comments`)
- ✅ Implement third rule (`no-hardcoded-credentials`)
- ✅ Add tests and documentation

### Phase 2: Core Rules
- Implement additional core rules:
  - `no-large-functions`: Warn on functions exceeding a specific line count
  - `comment-to-code-ratio`: Ensure sufficient comments in code
  - `complexity-limits`: Warn on overly complex code blocks
  - `descriptive-names`: Enforce descriptive variable/function naming

### Phase 3: AI-Specific Rules
- Implement rules targeting common AI code generation issues:
  - `no-redundant-code`: Detect unnecessary duplicated code
  - `consistent-style`: Ensure consistent coding style
  - `complete-error-handling`: Verify error handling in generated code
  - `security-best-practices`: Check for common security issues

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Create rule sets for different AI tools
- Add auto-fix capabilities where appropriate
- Implement configuration presets
- Add TypeScript-specific rules

## Release Strategy

1. **v0.1.0**: Initial release with `max-file-lines` rule
2. **v0.2.0**: Core rules implementation
3. **v0.3.0**: AI-specific rules implementation
4. **v1.0.0**: Stable release with comprehensive rule set and documentation

## Maintenance Plan

- Regular updates to align with ESLint versions
- Community feedback incorporation
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimization
